                <h1>A Little About Myself</h1>
                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Dylan I'm 18 years old, and i was born an raised in Oshkosh WI. I spend a lot of my free time either fishing or just spending time with friends and family, i used to play football and baseball when i was younger but i fell out of it when i came into high school.I am currently a student at FVTC just like all of you, my program is IT Web Development & Design and that is my only program. I am in my second semester and I'm really enjoying it so far, and so excited for what is to come. In my program i am working toward my associates degree, i still have not  decided if i want to continue my schooling after my program is complete here or to transfer credits to a university, but i do know that i will stick in the IT field for the rest of my life.
